## A collection of exercises for Raspberry Pi

### Exercise: Binary Numbers to LEDs

Your task is to write a program that waits for the user to press a button on the proto board.
When the user presses the button, a variable is incremented by one. If the value is over seven,
then the variable is set to zero. By pressing the button repeatedly, you can cycle the variable
through numbers 0 – 7. In addition to incrementing the variable, the program displays the number
in binary using the proto board’s LEDs.

### Exercise: ADC to LED blink

Reading RPI Pico ADC value in MicroPython

In this exercise you need to implement a program that reads ADC value and blinks the Pico’s onboard LED.
The frequency of blinking is controlled by the ADC count.
